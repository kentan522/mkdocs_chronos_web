Welcome to Chronos Web's documentation!
=======================================
The Chronos simulator is a multi-agent, time-based simulator designed to enable flexible, modular, and bespoke simulation solutions to a variety of different issues. Acting as a successor to the Delos3 logistics simulator, rewritten and optmised for Python, it should provide a combination of speed, flexibility, and ease of use.

This documentation serves to provide details on the interactive web interface built for the deployment of Chronos on it, as well as guidelines on how to develop Chronos with it. 

.. note::

   This project is currently under active development.



The following shows the contents that will be covered in the documentation. Feel free to navigate to whichever section that you are interested in.

In summary, this documentation will go through the preparation guidelines for setting up your environment for the web interface, the design principles of the repository, how to develop Chronos applications with it, a list of bugs/features to be fixed 
and finally future development plans to consider. 

Note: the repository can be located under the branch **chronosweb_core**, and the documentation will discuss primarily on this branch, as well as refer to this branch for most examples unless specified otherwise.
